# ursina-pong
This is a random game of pong I made as project for my computer science class. It uses the Ursina game engine, which is a wrapper for Panda3D. It is written in Python.

Since this is a one-off project, I will not be updating or maintaining this project and therefore, feel free to do absolutely anything with this code. Also don't judge me for my bad code lol.
